			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/profilePicture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Jose E. Velez Lespier">

			<p>My name is Jose Enrique Velez Lespier.  I am from Puerto Rico and I am 23 years old.  I have been studying for a few years now. I started in the prestigious University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez precinct.  I moved then to the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico and finished my major in electrical engineer.  I also majored in Computer engineering and I loved it.</p>

			<p>I like everything that involves some kind of intelligence or electricity.  If someone asked me what I am really good at, I would say mathematics, science, and my favorite which is technology.  I believe that technology reflects who we are as a society today and it also reflects how much we have grown intellectually.  I really enjoy when I try new things on my computer even if there are risks.  Finally, learning everyday and overcoming my challenges has made me a better person.</p>
